<h4>Bundled Plugins</h4>

With this release GoCD provides support for [Pipleine as code](https://docs.gocd.org/current/advanced_usage/pipelines_as_code.html) through [JSON config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-json-config-plugin) and the [YAML config repo plugin](https://github.com/tomzo/gocd-yaml-config-plugin). These plugins maintained by our core contributor [Tomasz Sętkowski](https://github.com/tomzo) will be bundled by default.

<h4>Deprecations</h4>

Features that become superseded or irrelevant become *deprecated*, and are scheduled to be removed in some timeframe.

The following features have been deprecated. Please note the timeframe of when they will be removed.

* Support for in-built password file and LDAP/AD authentication have been deprecated as of this release. Support for these authentication mechanisms would be removed in 17.9 release (scheduled to be released in September 2018).

* The [Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.org/current/authorization/) endpoints were introduced as an extension to the existing Authentication Plugin endpoints, with this we are deprecating the Authentication Plugin endpoint. Support for this plugin would be removed in 18.1 (scheduled to be release in January 2018). Plugin developers are encouraged to migrate their plugins to use the new Authorization Plugins.
