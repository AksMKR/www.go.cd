    <h3>Model complex workflows</h3>
    <div class="feature-1-image"></div>
    <p>With its parallel and sequential execution, GoCD can easily configure dependencies for fast feedback and on-demand deployment. Its fan-in/fan-out dependency management always does the "right thing," avoiding spurious builds.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature-col">
    <h3>Easily compare builds</h3>
    <div class="feature-2-image"></div>
    <p>GoCD's ability to compare content - both files and commit messages - across any two arbitrary builds, makes it invaluable when troubleshooting a broken pipeline.</p>
  </div>

   <div class="feature-col">
    <h3>Clearly visualize your workflow</h3>
    <div class="feature-3-image"></div>
    <p>GoCD's Value Stream Map visualizes your end-to-end workflow in real time. Every change can be tracked from commit to deploy and back again.</p>
