          If you want to receive useful information about GoCD but don't want to follow the detailed discussions of
          the user group, this is the place for you. Periodically, ThoughtWorks (GoCD's primary sponsor) will send
          updates about GoCD, including information like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Release and feature announcements</li>
          <li>Security related announcements</li>
          <li>Learning resources</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The volume of emails will be extremely low and will focus only on information we truly believe has real
          value to people using GoCD.
